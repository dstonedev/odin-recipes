# odin-recipes

The focus of this project is to practise recent learned html skils. 

I will be creating a basic html website with multiple recipes, this will allow me to put in practise 
the recent learned html elements and atributes. Creating paragraphs, headings, organized lists, 
unorganized lists, headings etc.
